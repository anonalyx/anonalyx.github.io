# Final Report: Analysis of CryptoZombies Extension Project
## Introduction

This report evaluates the CryptoZombies extension project, a React-based web application integrating Hardhat, Solidity, and Web3.js technologies. The project aimed to create an interactive front-end for a blockchain-based game, with a specific focus on user experience, performance, and functionality. Specifically, the project extends the cryptozombies tutorial, which demonstrates basic solidity smart contracts functionality for a web3 nft zombie game.

## Project Overview
The project consisted of several key components:

- Smart Contracts & ABI for CryptoZombies Game: Utilizing Solidity and deployed on a Hardhat local server.
- MetaMask Wallet Integration: For account tracking and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.
- React Web Application: Containing the application logic and basic UI elements.

## Assessment Against Objectives and Criteria
### Functionality
The application implemented core features such as account tracking and basic game functionalities.
It partially missed expanded smart contract functionalities, which could limit the game experience. The implementation of real-time notifications, such as account switching, enhanced the user experience by providing dynamic feedback and interaction. This feature demonstrated successful integration of blockchain events with the front-end.


### Usability
The interface was user-friendly, with a clear layout and intuitive controls.
The minimalistic design contributed to ease of use, though it might have affected the aesthetic appeal.

### Code Quality

The code structure was not optimal, reflecting the complexity and learning curve associated with integrating multiple new technologies.
A more structured and modular approach might benefit future maintenance and scalability. Combining multiple frameworks meant the complexity of the codebase quickly expanded beyond what was needed. Solidity, hardhat, and react all required massive supporting libraries.

### Performance

Locally, the application performed efficiently with optimized blockchain calls. However, the file size of the application was extremely large given the overhead of the frameworks, and could not be uploaded to github directly without significantly massaging the repository. I do find this concerning when thing about developing with frameworks in the future.

Performance in a hosted environment remains uncertain and warrants further testing.

### Documentation

The lack of comprehensive documentation could pose challenges for future development and handovers.
Essential for maintaining and scaling the project, documentation should be prioritized in subsequent phases.

### Project Completion and Learning Outcomes
While all primary objectives were not fully met, significant progress was made in integrating diverse technologies. My primary goal was to push myself into web3 further and to learn more about developing decentralized applications. I achieved this, and I also exposed myself to frontend development for the first time (something I hope to never do again!)

The experience provided valuable insights into blockchain application development, front-end design, and the challenges of working with multiple new technologies simultaneously. If I could repeat the experience, I would make sure that I was only learning one new thing at a time, rather than trying to approach two new development frameworks simultaneously. This gave me a sense though of how modern applications are really multiple subapplications housed under one banner.

### Recommendations for Future Development
Expanded Smart Contract Functionalities: Further development to include all planned game features.
Code Refactoring: Structuring the code for better readability and maintenance.
Performance Testing: Evaluating the application in a hosted environment to ensure consistent performance.
Enhanced UI Design: Improving the aesthetic and functional aspects of the UI.
Comprehensive Documentation: Essential for future development, maintenance, and scalability.
Conclusion
The CryptoZombies extension project represents a significant learning experience in blockchain and front-end development. Despite some shortcomings, the project laid a solid foundation for future enhancements and learning in blockchain application development.
