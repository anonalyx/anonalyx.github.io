Weekly Update (2)

What was accomplished in the last week

Over the last week I talked to my engineering manager about projects that might coincide with the requirements of this class and be a good fit for the semester long project. I am currently thinking about a relevant exercise with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, as these are three technologies I am very interested in.


What is planned to be accomplished in the next week

Over the next week, I will finalize a proposal for that plan and submit it.


What went well in the process/plan for the week

I think that it was encouraging that my Engineering manager was supportive of my project, and he had great advice on things I should consider


What are some ideas for improvement in your process

I am obviously just getting started, so a regular cadence of accountability and deliverables will be critical to establishing a productive work process
