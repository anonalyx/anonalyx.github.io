## Weekly Update (2)

What was accomplished in the last week

Over the last week I talked to my engineering manager about projects that might coincide with the requirements of this class and be a good fit for the semester long project. I am currently thinking about a relevant exercise with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, as these are three technologies I am very interested in.


What is planned to be accomplished in the next week

Over the next week, I will finalize a proposal for that plan and submit it.


What went well in the process/plan for the week

I think that it was encouraging that my Engineering manager was supportive of my project, and he had great advice on things I should consider


What are some ideas for improvement in your process

I am obviously just getting started, so a regular cadence of accountability and deliverables will be critical to establishing a productive work process

## Weekly Update (3)
What I accomplished last week:       - Began research on docker, kubernetes, and aws.- completed my project proposal,
What I plan to accomplish this week: - Research and learn more about docker, kubernetes, and aws!- continue to investigate feasibility and scoping,
What went well:                      - Preparing for technical coding interviews is very difficult to manage in addition to work and schoolwork,
How can I improve the process:       - Finding the time to manage everything I have going on feels like one of those interval scheduling  dynamic programming problems in algorithms,

## Weekly Update (4)
What I accomplished last week:       This week, I decided to pivot from my original docker, kubernetes, AWS project idea to one that more closely aligns with my interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I happened to work through the short CryptoZombies tutorial that is an introduction to working with web3 libraries, and at the end they give you 10 ideas on how to round out the tutorial into a full blown application however they leave the actual research and implementation decisions up to you.,
What I plan to accomplish this week: Complete project proposal,
What blockers did I face:            I don't yet know whether I can sketch out and complete a full project proposal ,
How can I improve the process:       Put into practice concrete project management processes, document milestones, and record artifacts,

## Weekly Update (6)
What I accomplished last week:       Last week and this week, I've been heavily focused on learning the Go programming language, as it is one of the languages that is compatible with many of the Web3 libraries. I completed several tutorials, walked through much of the documentation, and began to work with the Gin web application framework.,
What I plan to accomplish this week: I plan to refactor my personal website in Go, and host it on a cloud service.,
What went well:                      The documentation on Gin specifically is very light, and it's been a bit of a process tracking down all the relevant tutorials and references.,
How can I improve the process:       This past week, I was focused on really just learning the language, however over the coming weeks, I will be more focused on implementing and building things in the language to solidify my knowledge.,

## Mid-Semester Project Report - Alex Cullen
Unfortunately, I had a medical emergency in my family two weeks ago, and that has significantly impacted my focus and ability to make progress on my project. I have made substantial progress in completing the Crypto Zombies tutorial, as well as learning and implementing the Gin web framework, which will be the back-end of my app. I am behind on learning the Web3 crypto libraries, react, and some of the AWS and IPFS technologies. However, I feel good about my progress so far and my ability to implement and complete the project over the remainder of the class, especially as I get back on track after the last two weeks of distraction.

## Week 10 Status - Alex Cullen
A bit late on this one, but wanted to make sure that I got it in.
The last two weeks, I’ve been struggling to uphold all my responsibilities and support an immediate family member. 
Last week, I’ve been continuing my Go and Gin tutorials, I find Go to be a very fun language to write code in. It gives me the flexibility of a modern programming language, with the performance of C or Java. 
Next week, i hope to spend more time on React and other front-end languages to get a better sense of what implementing writing a dynamic web page


## Week 11 Status - Alex Cullen
This week I did not make as much progress on my project as I had hoped. I had several online assessments and coding interviews which required me to invest a couple dozen hours grinding leetcode problems. Something I’m struggling with is balancing internship preparation and academic projects.
Next week, I hope to pick up where I left off on my project, focusing on the front elements of the Svelete framework, and potentially HTM

## Week 12 Status - Alex Cullen
This week I began to implement the smart contract and some of the underlying features for the Zombie contract on ethereum. I may have to migrate to polygon given the high cost of gas at this time.
My focus for next week will be on building out my unit testing framework to make sure that the application has full coverage.
The big blockers I am working through currently include continuing support for my family given our immediate medical emergency.

## Week 13 Status - Alex Cullen
Pulling in to the home stretch! I feel good about the progress I was.able to make over thanksgiving, including some of the more sophisticated front-end performance improvement research. I don’t think I’ll be able to implement any of the super complicated strategies, just given how much more time and energy it would take to scale over all web pages, but it’s good to have reviewed the caching strategies.
No blockers this week, and next week I expect to have completed the project, turning to the final report!

## Week 14 Status - Alex Cullen
This is my last week finalizing the project, and the last week that I will be working on the actual code itself. This project was difficult and ambitious, and I’m excited that I was able to see it through to the end.
Ultimately, there was some functionality, especially on the front-end that I was not able to fully implement, and the scope of my project was slightly too large for the time frame allotted.
My focus this week is cleaning up the code, and doing some minor refactoring to make sure that everything is presentable for the final report. My biggest blocker next week is preparing for all of the exams, homework assignments, and other final projects I have to complete going into this last semester.

## Week 15 Status - Alex Cullen
This is the last week I will be working on the project for this course. I faced several impediments on my way to closing out the project and completing the upload, including continued family health issues, substantial deadlines in multiple other classes, and some technical issues that cropped towards the end of my project. I definitely did not get all that I wanted to completed, but I learned a lot about web3 along the way and that was my goal.
