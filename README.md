Weekly Update (2

What was accomplished in the last week

Over the last week I talked to my engineering manager about projects that might coincide with the requirements of this class and be a good fit for the semester long project. I am currently thinking about a relevant exercise with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, as these are three technologies I am very interested in.


What is planned to be accomplished in the next week

Over the next week, I will finalize a proposal for that plan and submit it.


What went well in the process/plan for the week

I think that it was encouraging that my Engineering manager was supportive of my project, and he had great advice on things I should consider


What are some ideas for improvement in your process

I am obviously just getting started, so a regular cadence of accountability and deliverables will be critical to establishing a productive work process


What I accomplished last week:       - Began research on docker, kubernetes, and aws.- completed my project proposal,
		What I plan to accomplish this week: - Research and learn more about docker, kubernetes, and aws!- continue to investigate feasibility and scoping,
		What went well:                      - Preparing for technical coding interviews is very difficult to manage in addition to work and schoolwork,
		How can I improve the process:       - Finding the time to manage everything I have going on feels like one of those interval schedulingÂ  dynamic programming problems in algorithms,

		What I accomplished last week:       This week, I decided to pivot from my original docker, kubernetes, AWS project idea to one that more closely aligns with my interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I happened to work through the short CryptoZombies tutorial that is an introduction to working with web3 libraries, and at the end they give you 10 ideas on how to round out the tutorial into a full blown application however they leave the actual research and implementation decisions up to you.,
		What I plan to accomplish this week: Complete project proposal,
		What blockers did I face:            I don't yet know whether I can sketch out and complete a full project proposal ,
		How can I improve the process:       Put into practice concrete project management processes, document milestones, and record artifacts,

		What I accomplished last week:       Last week and this week, I've been heavily focused on learning the Go programming language, as it is one of the languages that is compatible with many of the Web3 libraries. I completed several tutorials, walked through much of the documentation, and began to work with the Gin web application framework.,
		What I plan to accomplish this week: I plan to refactor my personal website in Go, and host it on a cloud service.,
		What went well:                      The documentation on Gin specifically is very light, and it's been a bit of a process tracking down all the relevant tutorials and references.,
		How can I improve the process:       This past week, I was focused on really just learning the language, however over the coming weeks, I will be more focused on implementing and building things in the language to solidify my knowledge.,
